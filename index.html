						Wine making has been around for thousands of years. In its basic
						form, wine production is a natural process that requires very little
						human intervention. Mother Nature provides everything that is needed
						to make wine; it is up to humans to embellish, improve, or totally
						obliterate what nature has provided, to which anyone with extensive
						wine tasting experience can attest. There are five basic stages or
						steps to making wine: harvesting, crushing and pressing,
						fermentation, clarification, and then aging and bottling.
						Undoubtedly, one can find endless deviations and variations along
						the way. In fact, it is the variants and little deviations at any
						point in the process that make life interesting. They also make each
						wine unique and ultimately contribute to the greatness or ignominy
						of any particular wine. The steps for making white wine and red wine
						are basically the same, with one exception. The making of rosé wines
						and fortified or sparkling wines is also another matter; both
						require additional human intervention to succeed.

									<h1>Planting</h1>
									<p>
										Imagine you're starting with raw land. First, you have to
										assess the soil and the climate to determine which grapes
										will flourish. In the Napa Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon is
										king. But that doesn't mean it's right for every location.
										Rocky soil and warm temperatures are excellent for growing
										Cab. Cooler microclimates and sandier soil provide great
										growing conditions for Sauvignon Blanc. A vineyard manager
										may also recommended planting smaller amounts of other
										grapes for blending, such as Malbec and Petit Verdot. Some
										vineyards strive to grow all five of the “noble” Bordeaux
										grapes: Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Malbec, Merlot,
										and Cabernet Franc. Others focus on just one varietal, like
										Cab. Fun fact: Although Malbec has become synonymous with
										excellent wine from Argentina, its roots are French! In
										addition to assessing microclimates and choosing the right
										grapes for each site in a new vineyard, the vineyard manager
										decides how to orient the rows, how to space and trellis the
										vines, and how to amend the soil, if necessary. Once each
										baby vine is planted, it's covered with a carton to provide
										warmth and protection as it begins to grow. A newly planted
										vineyard looks like this:
									</p>
								</li>
								<li id="flowering">
									<img
										src="http://www.csslab.cl/ejemplos/timelinr/latest/images/2.png"
									/>
									<h1>flowering</h1>
									<p>
										When wines emerge from dormancy, the first buds appear. This
										period is called bud break, and it generally starts in
										March. That's also when colorful mustard, a cover crop,
										blankets the ground between vine rows. The nights, however,
										can be a different story. Vineyard managers keep a careful
										eye on nighttime temperatures because if the thermometer
										dips below freezing, all those tender shoots can sustain
										serious damage — especially once the buds swell into
										flowers. The flowering stage happens about a month after bud
										break. Some vineyards use giant wind machines to circulate
										the air and keep cold air from damaging the vines. While
										living among the vineyards is certainly picturesque, being
										jolted from a deep sleep at 3:00 AM by a giant fan that
										makes as much noise as a low-flying plane is a drawback. But
										what's a little lost shut-eye if it means protecting the
										harvest? Other vineyards protect new growth by using huge
										sprinklers to coat the vines with water. It may seem
										counter-intuitive, but when the water freezes on the vines,
										it actually protects them because the freezing process
										produces a little bit of heat. It's science. Because there
										are so many different microclimates within the Napa Valley,
										flowering can take place over a two-month period.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li id="fruit">
									<img
										src="http://www.csslab.cl/ejemplos/timelinr/latest/images/3.png"
									/>
									<h1>fruit set</h1>
									<p>
										Most grapevines self-pollinate, after which fruit set
										occurs. This is when you'll see small, green clusters of
										grapes on the vines. Fruit set usually begins in May, and if
										the weather doesn't cooperate, vineyard managers still have
										to worry about frost. Not all the vines will pollinate, so
										fruit set is an important indicator of crop yield. If many
										of the vines aren't showing fruit clusters, yields will be
										low. In Napa, where Cabernet grapes can command an average
										of $6,300 a ton, low yields can be an economic disaster for
										vineyard owners. Around this time, vineyard crews will work
										on canopy management, or leafing, to control the amount of
										sunlight and air that the fruit clusters receive. Grapes
										need sunlight to ripen, but too much sun can give the fruit
										a sunburn. According to Napa Valley Vintners, vineyard
										workers may tend to each row of vines 20 times in a single
										growing season. In addition to canopy management, the
										vineyard workers will inspect the fruit clusters and cut
										away any clusters that aren't developing properly. It can be
										tough for growers to see so much fruit dropped, but this
										crop thinning helps the vines send their energy only to the
										best clusters and results in high-quality fruit. The Napa
										Valley Vintners point out that while Napa vineyards produce
										only about half the fruit per acre compared with other
										grape-growing regions, the price per ton for Napa grapes is
										about five times higher than for other California grapes.
										So, the quality control pays off in the long run.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li id="veraison">
									<img
										src="http://www.csslab.cl/ejemplos/timelinr/latest/images/4.png"
									/>
									<h1>veraison</h1>
									<p>
										Veraison is the magical moment when those hard, green grapes
										transform into plump, juicy clusters. Veraison is especially
										noticeable in red grapes as the fruit turns from green to
										purple. In white grapes, like Sauvignon Blanc and
										Chardonnay, the clusters turn from bright green to a more
										mellow golden green.
										<span
											>VeraisonVeraison occurs in the warm summer months as the
											grape clusters ripen and develop sugars. The grapes soften
											and change color.
										</span>
										Veraison is an indication that the grapes are ripening and
										developing sugars. In Napa, this usually happens in late
										July or August. Vineyard workers will watch the grape
										clusters carefully. They may prune the canopy of grape
										leaves again to allow for more ripening, or they may drop
										more fruit if they see too many clusters or uneven ripening.
										Napa has a Mediterranean climate, with warm to hot sunny
										days and cooler nights. The heat of the day promotes sugar
										development and allows the grapes to ripen, while the lower
										nighttime temperatures keep the grapes' acids from
										dissipating completely. The balance between sugar and acid
										is what makes Napa grapes so sought after for winemaking.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li id="harvest">
									<img
										src="http://www.csslab.cl/ejemplos/timelinr/latest/images/5.png"
									/>
									<h1>harvest</h1>
									<p>
										At last, the time has come to harvest those beautiful
										grapes! But how do growers know when to pick? It's certainly
										not an exact science, although winemakers and vineyard
										managers will measure the sugar levels in the grapes (called
										Brix). A series of warm days can speed up harvest because
										ripening happens fast in hot weather. Cooler temperatures,
										on the other hand, can delay harvest. But ultimately, it's
										the flavor profile of the grape that determines pick date.
										White grapes are harvested earlier than red grapes. But
										grapes meant to be used in sparkling wine are harvested
										earliest of all because a lower sugar content in those
										grapes is desirable. In fact, Mumm Napa is almost always the
										first to harvest. In 2015, Mumm kicked off the harvest on
										July 22, the earliest start on record. Whites like
										Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc are harvested next, often in
										August and September. These grapes just don't need as much
										time on the vine to ripen. Pinot Noir, Merlot, and Malbec
										come in next. Finally, Cabernet Sauvignon and other robust
										reds like Petite Sirah are harvested.Harvesting usually
										starts in the wee hours of the morning—perhaps around 3:00
										AM, when the air is cool. That's because winemakers don't
										want the grapes to start fermenting before they reach the
										crush pad, and the heat of the day will absolutely start the
										fermentation process. It's been three long years from
										planting to first harvest, and we still don't have an ounce
										of wine! But don't worry—once all the grapes are harvested,
										the winemaking process begins in earnest. Here's what
										happens after the grapes are plucked from the vine and
										placed in the harvest bins.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li id="crush">
									<img
										src="http://www.csslab.cl/ejemplos/timelinr/latest/images/6.png"
									/>
									<h1>crush</h1>
									<p>
										Grape juice starts out clear, whether it comes from red wine
										grapes or white wine grapes. In order for red wine to pick
										up that beautiful color, the grape skins must remain in
										contact with the juice. First, the grapes get sent through a
										destemmer because the stems contain tannins, and the wine
										will pick up plenty of tannins from contact with the stems.
										Then, the grape clusters are crushed to break open the
										berries.After crushing and destemming, the red grapes are
										put into a tank for primary fermentation.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li id="press">
									<img
										src="http://www.csslab.cl/ejemplos/timelinr/latest/images/7.png"
									/>
									<h1>press</h1>
									<p>
										White wine grapes, which are harvested earlier than red wine
										grapes, often go right from the field to the press.
										Sometimes, the grapes are crushed, but certain winemakers
										choose to skip that step. Instead, they press whole clusters
										of grapes, skins, stems, seeds, and all, and the juice goes
										directly into the barrel or the tank to begin the
										fermentation process. White grapes are usually pressed
										quickly to ensure minimal contact between the juice and the
										skins, stems, and seeds. That way, the resulting white wine
										won't pick up unwanted color or tannins. Once the grapes are
										pressed, the skins, seeds, and stems clump together into
										“pomace,” which can be returned to the vineyard soil as a
										fertilizer. Red grapes won't be pressed until after primary
										fermentation.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li id="fermentation">
									<img
										src="http://www.csslab.cl/ejemplos/timelinr/latest/images/8.png"
									/>
									<h1>fermentation</h1>
									<p>
										At this point, the red grapes have been destemmed and
										crushed, while the white grapes have been pressed. Now,
										primary fermentation begins, and it can last up to a month.
										Once yeast converts the sugars from the grapes into alcohol,
										the red wine grapes are pressed and the juice is pumped into
										barrels (or some other vessel) for aging. Since the white
										wine grapes have already been pressed, what happens next
										depends on the varietal. Chardonnay requires malolactic
										fermentation to develop creamy, buttery flavors, so it will
										go into barrels for further fermentation. In Sauvignon
										Blanc, on the other hand, a certain crisp acidity is
										desirable, so winemakers will work to prevent malolactic
										fermentation in these grapes.
										<br />
										After primary fermentation, the wine will be transferred
										from the fermentation tank to another vessel for aging.
										Sauvignon Blanc often goes into stainless steel tanks or a
										concrete egg, while Chardonnay and red wines will go into
										oak barrels. New French oak? American oak? Hungarian oak?
										Light toast? Dark toast? Reused barrels? The question of
										which oak barrel to use is a subject that many winemakers
										are passionate about. There's no one right answer. It all
										depends on the flavor profile that the winemaker hopes to
										achieve. Malolactic fermentation (ML) takes place during the
										aging process. All red wine goes through ML, and certain
										whites, like Chardonnay, also go through ML. This process is
										what gives Chardonnay its creamy mouthfeel and some of that
										signature buttery flavor. Malic acid, which is commonly
										described as having a “green apple” flavor, gets converted
										to lactic aid, which is creamy, smooth, and buttery. Make
										Your Own Wine At Home Make Your Own Wine at Home In red
										wine, you won't necessarily taste a buttery flavor, but you
										may sense a nutty aroma, and the wine may feel satiny in
										your mouth. ML is what helps provide a smooth, rich
										mouthfeel.

									/>
									<h1>racking</h1>
									<p>
										Toward the end of the aging process, winemakers will taste
										the wine frequently to ensure the flavors are just right.
										They do this with a “wine thief,” a special tool that
										extracts a small amount of wine from the container it's
										aging in. Using a Wine ThiefWinemakers use a tool called a
										wine thief to taste unfinished wine as it ages in the
										barrel. Before bottling, the wine is racked, filtered, or
										both to remove sediment and clarify the wine. At last, it's
										time to fire up the bottling line! Small producers, like
										Bos, can set up a small bottling line and complete bottling
										in an hour or so. But then, he's only bottling 55 cases.
										Larger producers, like Grgich Hills, where Bos used to work
										as a vineyard manager, may be bottling 30,000 cases of
										Chardonnay alone. They use much more powerful bottling lines
										and can bottle as many as 200 cases in an hour. Even with
										the fastest technology, the more wine you have to bottle,
										the longer the process will take.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li id="bottle">
									<img
										src="http://www.csslab.cl/ejemplos/timelinr/latest/images/10.png"
									/>
									<h1>bottle</h1>
									<p>
										“Wine is a living process, not a product,” Bos says. “People
										age wine because they think it's going to get better, and
										oftentimes, they're right. It's also cool to taste the
										differences that emerge as wine gets older.” Yes, wine will
										continue to change in the bottle. That's why proper wine
										storage is so important. To ensure that a special bottle you
										purchased will still be drinkable 10 or even 20 years from
										now, you need to store it in a climate-controlled
										environment with just the right level of humidity. After
										all, that wine you purchased may have been five years or
										more in the making. Show it some respect with proper storage
										in a wine refrigerator, so that you can enjoy your wine now
										— and for years to come.
